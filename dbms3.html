        <ul>
        <li> The data which is stored in the database at a particular moment of time is called an instance of the database.</li>
        <li> The overall design of a database is called schema.</li>
        <li> A database schema is the skeleton structure of the database. It represents the logical view of the entire database.</li>
        <li> A schema contains schema objects like table, foreign key, primary key, views, columns, data types, stored procedure, etc.</li>
        <li> A database schema can be represented by using the visual diagram. That diagram shows the database objects and relationship with each other.</li>
        <li> A database schema is designed by the database designers to help programmers whose software will interact with the database. The process of database creation is called data modeling.</li>
