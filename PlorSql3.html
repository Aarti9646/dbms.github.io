 <h1 align="center">If-Else in PL/SQL</h1>
<p>PL/SQL supports the programming language features like conditional statements and iterative statements. Its programming constructs are similar to how you use in programming languages like Java and C++.</p>

<h3> Syntax for IF Statement: </h3>

<p>There are different syntaxes for the IF-THEN-ELSE statement.</p>

<h3> Syntax: (IF-THEN statement): </h3>
<pre class="code">
IF condition   
THEN   
Statement: {It is executed when condition is true}  
END IF;  
</pre>
<p>This syntax is used when you want to execute statements only when condition is TRUE.</p>
<h3> Syntax: (IF-THEN-ELSE statement): </h3>
<pre class="code">
IF condition   
THEN  
   {...statements to execute when condition is TRUE...}  
ELSE  
   {...statements to execute when condition is FALSE...}  
END IF;   
</pre>
<p>This syntax is used when you want to execute one set of statements when condition is TRUE or a different set of statements when condition is FALSE.</p>
<h3> Syntax: (IF-THEN-ELSIF statement): </h3>
<pre class="code">
IF condition1   
THEN  
   {...statements to execute when condition1 is TRUE...}  
ELSIF condition2   
THEN  
   {...statements to execute when condition2 is TRUE...}  
END IF;  
</pre>
<p>This syntax is used when you want to execute one set of statements when condition1 is TRUE or a different set of statements when condition2 is TRUE.</p>
<h3> Syntax: (IF-THEN-ELSIF-ELSE statement):
<pre class="code">
IF condition1   
THEN  
   {...statements to execute when condition1 is TRUE...}  
ELSIF condition2   
THEN  
   {...statements to execute when condition2 is TRUE...}  
ELSE  
   {...statements to execute when both condition1 and condition2 are FALSE...}  
END IF;  
</pre>
<p>For example :
</p>
<pre class="example">
DECLARE  
   age number(2) := 50;  
BEGIN  
   -- check the boolean condition using if statement   
   IF( age < 20 ) THEN  
      -- if condition is true then print the following    
      dbms_output.put_line('age is less than 20 ' );  
   ELSE  
      dbms_output.put_line('age is not less than 20 ' );  
   END IF;  
   dbms_output.put_line('value of age is : ' || age);  
END;  
</pre>
<h3>Output :</h3>
<p> age is not less than 20 </p>
<p> value of age is : 50 </p>
