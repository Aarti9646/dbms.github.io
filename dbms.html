        <h1><font color="orange">What is DBMS?</font></h1>

Database Management System (DBMS) is software for storing and retrieving users data while<br>
considering appropriate security measures. It consists of a group of programs that<br>
manipulate the database. The DBMS accepts the request for data from an application and<br>
instructs the operating system to provide the specific data. In large systems, a DBMS helps<br>
users and other third-party software store and retrieve data.<br>
<h2><font color="orange">Some key features of a DBMS include:</font></h2><br>
1.Data modeling: A DBMS provides tools for creating and modifying data models, which define<br>
the structure and relationships of the data in a database.<br><br>
2.Data storage and retrieval: A DBMS is responsible for storing and retrieving data from the<br>
database, and can provide various methods for searching and querying the data.<br><br>
3.Concurrency control: A DBMS provides mechanisms for controlling concurrent access to the<br>
database, to ensure that multiple users can access the data without conflicting with each<br>
other.<br><br>
4.Data integrity and security: A DBMS provides tools for enforcing data integrity and security<br>
constraints, such as constraints on the values of data and access controls that restrict who<br>
can access the data.<br><br>
5.Backup and recovery: A DBMS provides mechanisms for backing up and recovering the data in<br>
the event of a system failure.<br><br>
6.DBMS can be classified into two types: Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)<br>
and Non-Relational Database Management System (NoSQL or Non-SQL)<br><br>
7.RDBMS: Data is organized in the form of tables and each table has a set of rows and columns.<br>
The data is related to each other through primary and foreign keys.<br><br>
8.NoSQL: Data is organized in the form of key-value pairs, document, graph, or column-based.<br> 
These are designed to handle large-scale, high-performance scenarios.<br><br>

<h2><font color="orange">Advantages of DBMS</h2></font><br>

1.Controls database redundancy: It can control data redundancy because it stores all the data<br> 
in one single database file and that recorded data is placed in the database.<br><br>
2.Data sharing: In DBMS, the authorized users of an organization can share the data among<br> 
multiple users.<br><br>
3.Easily Maintenance: It can be easily maintainable due to the centralized nature of the<br> 
database system.<br><br>
5.Reduce time: It reduces development time and maintenance need.<br><br>
6.Backup: It provides backup and recovery subsystems which create automatic backup of data <br>
from hardware and software failures and restores the data if required.<br><br>
7.multiple user interface: It provides different types of user<br>
interfaces like graphical user interfaces, application program interfaces<br><br>

<h2><font color="orange">Disadvantages of DBMS</font> </h2> <br>

1.Cost of Hardware and Software: It requires a high speed of data processor and large <br>
memory size to run DBMS software.<br><br>
2.Size: It occupies a large space of disks and large memory to run them efficiently.<br><br>
3.Complexity: Database system creates additional complexity and requirements.<br><br>
4.Higher impact of failure: Failure is highly impacted the database because in most of the <br>
organization, all the data stored in a single database and if the database is damaged due to <br>
electric failure or database corruption then the data may be lost forever.<br><br>
