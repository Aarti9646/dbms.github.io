       <h1 align="center">Variables</h1>
        <p>In PL/SQL, a variable is a meaningful name of a temporary storage location that supports a particular data type in a program. Before using a variable, you need to declare it first in the declaration section of a PL/SQL block.</p>
       <h3> PL/SQL variables naming rules</h3>

<p>Like other programming languages, a variable in PL/SQL must follow the naming rules as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li> The variable name must be less than 31 characters. Try to make it as meaningful as possible within 31 characters.</li>
<li> The variable name must begin with an ASCII letter. It can be either lowercase or uppercase. Notice that PL/SQL is case-insensitive, which means v_data and V_DATA refer to the same variable.</li>
<li> Followed by the first character are any number, underscore ( _), and dollar sign ( $) characters. Once again, do not make your variables hard to read and difficult to understand.</li>
</ul>


<h3>PL/SQL Variables Declaration</h3>
<p>To declare a variable, you use a variable name followed by the data type and terminated by a semicolon (;). You can also explicitly add a length constraint to the data type within parentheses. The following illustrates some examples of declaring variables in a PL/SQL anonymous block:</p>
<pre class="code">
    DECLARE
    v_fname varchar2(20);
    v_lname varchar2(20);
    n_salary_id number;
    d_join_date date;
 BEGIN
    NULL;
 END;
</pre>
<h3>Consonants</h3>
<p>A <strong>constant</strong> holds a value that once declared, does not change in the program. A constant declaration specifies its name, data type, and value, and allocates storage for it. The declaration can also impose the NOT NULL constraint.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax to declare a constant:</strong>

</p>
<p>
    constant_name CONSTANT datatype := VALUE;  </p>
<pre class="code">
    pi constant number := 3.141592654;  
</pre>
