 <h1 align="center">Cursors in PL/SQL</h1>
<p> When an SQL statement is processed, Oracle creates a memory area known as context area. A cursor is a pointer to this context area. It contains all information needed for processing the statement. In PL/SQL, the context area is controlled by Cursor. A cursor contains information on a select statement and the rows of data accessed by it.</p>

<p> A cursor is used to referred to a program to fetch and process the rows returned by the SQL statement, one at a time. There are two types of cursors:</p>
 
 <ol>
    <li>Implicit Cursors</li>
    <li>Explicit Cursors</li>
 </ol>
<p>
    The implicit cursors are automatically generated by Oracle while an SQL statement is executed, if you don't use an explicit cursor for the statement.
</p>
<p>
These are created by default to process the statements when DML statements like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE etc. are executed.
</p><p>
Orcale provides some attributes known as Implicit cursor's attributes to check the status of DML operations. Some of them are: %FOUND, %NOTFOUND, %ROWCOUNT and %ISOPEN.
