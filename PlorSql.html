        <h1 align="center" >What is PL/SQL ?</h1>
        <p>PL/SQL stands for Procedural Language extensions to the Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL is a powerful language for both querying and updating data in relational databases.</p>

   <h3>Features of PL/SQL</h3>
<ul>
<li> PL/SQL is tightly integrated with SQL. </li>
<li> It offers extensive error checking. </li>
<li> It offers numerous data types. </li>
<li> It offers a variety of programming structures. </li>
<li> It supports structured programming through functions and procedures. </li>
<li> It supports object-oriented programming. </li>
<li> It supports the development of web applications and server pages. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Advantages of PL/SQL</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
SQL is the standard database language and PL/SQL is strongly integrated with SQL. PL/SQL supports both static and dynamic SQL. Static SQL supports DML operations and transaction control from PL/SQL block. In Dynamic SQL, SQL allows embedding DDL statements in PL/SQL blocks.</li>

<li><strong>PL/SQL</strong> allows sending an entire block of statements to the database at one time. This reduces network traffic and provides high performance for the applications.</li>

<li><strong>PL/SQL</strong> gives high productivity to programmers as it can query, transform, and update data in a database.</li>

<li><strong>PL/SQL</strong> saves time on design and debugging by strong features, such as exception handling, encapsulation, data hiding, and object-oriented data types.
</li>
<li>Applications written in PL/SQL are fully portable.</li>

<li><strong>PL/SQL</strong> provides high security level.</li>

<li><strong>PL/SQL</strong> provides access to predefined SQL packages.</li>

<li><strong>PL/SQL</strong> provides support for Object-Oriented Programming.</li>

<li> <strong>PL/SQL</strong> provides support for developing Web Applications and Server Pages.</li>
