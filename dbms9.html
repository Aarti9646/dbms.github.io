        <h1 align="center" >MySQL Views</h1>
<p>A view is a database object that has no values. Its contents are based on the base table. It contains rows and columns similar to the real table. In MySQL, the View is a virtual table created by a query by joining one or more tables. It is operated similarly to the base table but does not contain any data of its own. The View and table have one main difference that the views are definitions built on top of other tables (or views). If any changes occur in the underlying table, the same changes reflected in the View also.</p>

<p>
    Syntax to create a view in MySQL:
</p>
    
<pre class="code">
CREATE [OR REPLACE] VIEW view_name AS    
SELECT columns    
FROM tables    
[WHERE conditions];    
</pre>
<p>We can see the created view by using the following syntax:
</p>
<pre class="code">
    SELECT * FROM view_name;    
</pre>
<p>Syntax used to delete the view:</p>

<pre class="code">
    DROP VIEW [IF EXISTS] view_name;   
</pre> 
<div class="toggle-page-btns">
<a href="dbms8.html" class="button">&larr; Previous</a>
<a href="dbms10.html" class="button">Next &rarr;</a>
</div>
