        <h1 <font align="center">MySQL Tables</font></h1>
       <p> A table is used to organize data in the form of rows and columns and used for both storing and displaying records in the structure format. It is similar to worksheets in the spreadsheet application. A table creation command requires three things: <strong>name of the table</strong>,
        <strong>Names of fields</strong>,
            <strong>Definitions for each field</strong></p>

<p>To create a table into the database by using the CREATE TABLE command. Following is a generic syntax for creating a MySQL table in the database.</p>
<pre class="code">
    CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] table_name(  
        column_definition1,  
        column_definition2,  
        ........,  
        table_constraints  
    );  
</pre>
<p>For example,let us create a table for student which includes fields/ columns like rollno,name , course and age.   </p>
<pre class="example">
    mysql> CREATE TABLE student(  
    rollno int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,  
    name varchar(45) NOT NULL,  
    course varchar(35) NOT NULL,  
    age int NOT NULL,  
    PRIMARY KEY (rollno)  
);  
</pre>
<h3>View or list all the tables present in the current working database</h3>
<p>We can get the number of table information of a database using the following statement:</p>
<pre class="code">
    show tables;
</pre>
<h3>MySQL DESCRIBE TABLE</h3>
<p>DESCRIBE means to show the information in detail. Since we have tables in MySQL, so we will use the DESCRIBE command to show the structure of our table, such as column names, constraints on column names, etc. The DESC command is a short form of the DESCRIBE command. Both DESCRIBE and DESC command are equivalent and case sensitive.</p>
<pre class="code">
    desc table_name;
</pre>
<h3>Delete a table</h3>
<p>MYSQL uses a Drop Table statement to delete the existing table. This statement removes the complete data of a table along with the whole structure or definition permanently from the database. So, you must be very careful while removing the table because we cannot recover the lost data after deleting it.</p>
<pre class="code">
    drop table table_name;
</pre>
